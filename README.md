#### 1. BUSINESS PROBLEM / OBJECTIVE:
> - The question that I am trying to answer is to build a classifier to correctly classify the wine on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 - lowest quality and 10 â€“ highest quality) basis the Physical characteristics and the Chemical composition of the wine, leveraging different supervised machine learning classification algorithms.
> - Objective here is to have the highest Accuracy and Recall  comparing with the research paper for which the best accuracy is ~ 60%

> - The business goal is to find a model that can predict in advance whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic, history and social and economic attributes (21 Numerical and Categorical variables in Dataset)
> - Better Management of available resources (human effort, phone calls and time)
> - Over **80% Accuracy and with 70% Recall of the positive class** (converted customers to subscription)
