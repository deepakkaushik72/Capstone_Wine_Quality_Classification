#### 1. BUSINESS PROBLEM / OBJECTIVE:
> - The question that I am trying to answer is to build a classifier to correctly classify the wine on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 - lowest quality and 10 – highest quality) basis the Physical characteristics and the Chemical composition of the wine, leveraging different supervised machine learning classification algorithms.
> - 1. Classsify the Wine Samples of White and Red wine on a scale of 1 to 10 and achieving a accuracy of over ~ 65%
> - 2. Recall of over 70% for class 5 and class 6
> - 3. Identify the features that influence the quality of wine the most
#### 2. Data Source: Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mihaltursukov/wine-quality/dataLinks to an external site.
> - 1. 6497 wine data points: 1599 for Red Wine with Quality ratings as 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 4898 for White Wine with Quality ratings 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
> - 2. 11 features/physical characteristics: ['fixed acidity', 'volatile acidity', 'citric acid', 'residual sugar', 'chlorides', 
   'free sulfur dioxide', 'total sulfur dioxide', 'density', 'pH', 'sulphates', 'alcohol', 'color']
> - 3. Output variable: “Quality” (1 through 10)

> Following are the Supervised Machine Learning algorithms that will be used to categorize the Wine quality and select the best 
basis the accuracy, Recall and interpretability:
> - 1. Logistics Regression 2. KNN 3. Decision Trees 4. Support Vector Machines 5. Random Forest 6. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) 7. Neural Networks
      
#### 3. SUCCESS METRICS:
> - 1. Accuracy score of Wine classification: Accuracy > 65%, Recall, Precision > 65%
> - 2. Highest Recall for Class 5 and 6 (over 70% for class 5 and class 6)
> - 3. Optimizing the F1 Score (Precision-Recall Tradeoff)
> - 4. Clear communication of the features that influence the Quality of Wine the most
