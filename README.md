#### 1. BUSINESS PROBLEM / OBJECTIVE:
> - The question that I am trying to answer is to build a classifier to correctly classify the wine on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 - lowest quality and 10 â€“ highest quality) basis the Physical characteristics and the Chemical composition of the wine, leveraging different supervised machine learning classification algorithms.
> - 1. Classsify the Wine Samples of White and Red wine on a scale of 1 to 10 and achieving a accuracy of over ~ 65%
> - 2. Recall of over 70% for class 5 and class 6
> - 3. Identify the features that influence the quality of wine the most
